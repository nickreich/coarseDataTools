# coarseDataTools 0.7 

* Refactor code to align with lintr standards, adding Hugo Gruson as contributor.

# coarseDataTools 0.6.6 

* update vignette to Rmd, removal of plot method for cd.fit object.

# coarseDataTools 0.6.5

# coarseDataTools 0.6.4 

* merged hackout3 branch to support new distributions

# coarseDataTools 0.6.3 

* minor modifications to address NAMESPACE issues.

# coarseDataTools 0.6 

* added Azman/Lessler contributions: MCMC estimation functions, ability to fit Weibull and Gamma distributions, and bootstrap confidence intervals.

# coarseDataTools 0.5.1 

* changed code to eliminate NOTE message in R CMD CHECK.

# coarseDataTools 0.5 

* added get.obs.type() function to easily generate observation types for data set up in doubly interval censored format. 

# coarseDataTools 0.4 

* added functions for simulation precision of estimated percentiles from coarse incubation period datasets.

# coarseDataTools 0.3  

* added documentation for datafiles.

# coarseDataTools 0.2 

* added functions (with documentation) for estimating a univariate distribution with an arbitrary mixture of doubly interval-censored, single interval-censored and exact observations using a maximum likelihood approach.  

# coarseDataTools 0.1 

* added functions (with documentation) for estimating the relative case fatality ratio.  Currently only tested on situations with two groups of interest, i.e. two levels of covariate J.
