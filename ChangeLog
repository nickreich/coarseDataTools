ChangeLog file for coarseDataTools

v0.1 - added functions (with documentation) for estimating the relative case fatality ratio.  Currently only tested on situations with two groups of interest, i.e. two levels of covariate J.

v0.2 - added functions (with documentation) for estimating a univariate distribution with an arbitrary mixture of doubly interval-censored, single interval-censored and exact observations using a maximum likelihood approach.  

v0.3 - added documentation for datafiles.

v0.4 - added functions for simulation precision of estimated percentiles from coarse incubation period datasets.

v0.5 - added get.obs.type() function to easily generate observation types for data set up in doubly interval censored format. 

v0.5.1 - changed code to eliminate NOTE message in R CMD CHECK.

v0.6 - added Azman/Lessler contributions: MCMC estimation functions, ability to fit Weibull and Gamma distributions, and bootstrap confidence intervals.

v06.3 - minor modifications to address NAMESPACE issues.

v06.4 - merged hackout3 branch to support new distributions

v06.5 - minor modifications to fix improper call to `class()` and other new NOTES.

v06.6 - update vignette to Rmd, minor modifications to fix S4 method documentation.
